# Scientifc Computing

Implementations of Numerical Methods for the course MTH373 Scientifc Computing taken by Dr. Kaushik Kalyanraman at IIIT Delhi during the Monsoon 2019 Semester.

## Course Description

This is an overview course to be offered to 3rd and 4th year undergraduate, and postgraduate students. The course is structured to systematically build on and provide an overview of several ideas and topics that comprise the basics of discretizations of continuous mathematics. This particular setup is concerned with computational as well as stability analyses of both methods and algorithms.
Following is a brief overview of the same:

+ Numerical Methods in linear algebra: matrix factorizations, direct solution of linear systems, solutions of linear least square problems, and solutions to eigenvalue problems.
+ Solutions of nonlinear equations in 1d, Nonlinear least squares problems.
+ Polynomial interpolation (including using splines) of discrete data in 1d.
+ Methods for numerical differentiation of sampled data, and for numerically carrying out integration in 1d.
+ Numerical solutions of initial and boundary value ordinary differential equations in 1d.
+ Numerical solution of model partial differential equations.
